# Spring 2018 SUNY Orange Computer Club Website
This is the official repository for the SUNY Orange Computer Club website. This will serve as a learning platform for club members.

# Learning Objectives
* Develop a solid grasp on the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and how they all work together. 
* Learn the basics of Git and GitHub.
* Gain experience with collaborative development.

# How to contribute
There will be a list of small projects that members can choose from to work on. This will be the best way to avoid repository conflicts and ensure that everyone has an equal opportunity to contribute. Claim a project, fork the repository, write your code, commit, and submit a pull request.

# Standards
The development of this project is a collaborative effort and nobody should be hesitant to contribute. However, in order to maintain efficiency and organization throughout development, we do need to follow a few standards.

Try to make your commits consist of a single specific goal. Multiple unrelated changes should have their own commits. For example, fixing a typo in the HTML content and fixing a bug in a JavaScript function should be two separate commits. Adding a new paragraph in the HTML content and creating a CSS entry to style it should be one commit. Ask yourself, "Does my last change have any direct relation to what I am about to change now?" If not, commit first.

Be descriptive and avoid vagueness with your commit messages. They should clearly indicate what you have added or changed.  

Remeber that multiple people will have to read your code. It must be clean and readable.

Make sure any code you are submitting in a pull request has been tested and works.
